    <h3>Orchard Design Studio</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">In more recent years Orchard Design has worked predominantly at an architectural scale completing multiple large scale sculpture works as well as numerous building and landscape projects. This has unlocked a new range of possibilities and allowed us to further explore our fascinations in relation to the interconnection between three-dimensional form and materiality - the intersection between contemporary design, architectural form and sculptural intent.
